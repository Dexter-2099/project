Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ involves setting up a 3x3 board using a 2D vector, implementing logic to check for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals), and handling player input with validation. The game alternates between two players ('X' and 'O') until one wins or the board is full, with options to replay or exit. Code modularity is achieved through functions for board display, move validation, and game flow control.
